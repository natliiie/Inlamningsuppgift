# ThisIsMe - React assignment

This is a basic application made in React. 
The assignment required three views in navigation, one form and usage of useState to handle formdata.

The application is basically my CV copied in to pages, so it's all about me! :) 
Sorry for the Swedish text, it's not yet translated to English.
